    "### Use SageMaker Feature Store and Apache Spark to generate point-in-time queries\n",
    "The following notebook uses SageMaker Feature Store and Apache Spark to build out a set of Dataframes and queries that provide a pattern for historical lookup capabilities. We will demonstrate how to build a \"point-in-time\" feature sets by starting with raw transactional data, joining that data with records from the Offline Store, and then building an \"entity\" dataset to define the items we care about and the timestamp of reference. Techniques include building Spark Dataframes, using outer and inner table joins, using Dataframe filters to prune items outside our timeframe, and finally using Spark `reduceByKey` to reduce the final the dataset.
