This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks plus some schema files used to create our Feature Groups. The purpose of the notebooks is described as:

•	1_generate_creditcard_transactions.ipynb : generates raw transaction data for credit cards and consumers
•	2_create_feature_groups.ipynb : creates two feature groups used to store aggregate features for consumer data and credit card data
•	3_fs_get_historical_features.ipynb: creates the periodic snapshots of aggregate data, writes them to the Feature Store, creates the entity dataframe, and creates and executes the point-in-time queries
